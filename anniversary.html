                        As the final class finished, I was excited to meet you up before going 
                        home. We spent the afternoon in SM Bicutan for another simple date that 
                        had been a memorable one too. As we strolled through the mall, surrounded 
                        by ebb and flow of shoppers, I couldn't help but be overwhelmed by the 
                        warmth and comfort of your presence. In your company, the chaos of outside 
                        world melted away, replaced by a sense of belonging that only you could 
                        provide.. Those simple moments spent together, amid the distractions and 
                        obligations of daily life, held an immeasurable significance. For in those 
                        stolent pockets of time, I found love in your embrace. 
                    </p>

                    <!--FIRST-HEADER-->
                    <h4> Hungry Jacks </h4>

                    <p> I think this was the first thing we did when we met at SM Bicutan. We went 
                        to Burger King to have a meal. It's nostalgic to think about those times 
                        when I used to work hard just to save money. Hahaha. And when we met, we 
                        would simply eat at fast-food restaurants.

                    <p> Furthermore, at this time we ate because we were hungry and the food was 
                        delicious. I don't know why, maybe because it was a rare occasion for us to 
                        eat at Burger King, but I really enjoyed their burgers because of the aroma. 
                        I don't know how they make their burgers, but they taste like smoked patties, 
                        and that's why I find them so tasty. And their fries are also delicious. I 
                        remember trying their onion rings, but I didn't like them because they only 
                        looked so appetizing in the pictures, and I was expecting them to taste like 
                        calamari. Hahaha. Since they're also rings, I regretted ordering them. LOL.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Miniso Bicutan </h4>

                    <p> This time, we were just looking for things we could buy or explore. It was 
                        just simply window shopping, one of our favorite activities because we didn't 
                        have money to make purchases. Hahaha. But we still enjoyed browsing and it gave 
                        us something to do and laugh about. Although we often didn't end up buying anything 
                        during our window shopping trips, we still went home feeling happy after our 
                        outings. And sometimes, the real purpose of our window shopping was to spot 
                        something we could potentially buy and save up for in the future.
                    </p>

                    <p> Most of the pictures we have, you're the one taking them. Hahaha. Basically, 
                        almost all of the pictures with me is myself. So it's kinda hard making this 
                        scrapsite both our point of views. Also, I don't have many good pictures with 
                        you, and you often spoil me in photos because I rarely post ony my socials. 
                        So I'm really delighted now that I have something to share. I love you so 
                        much. Hahaha. Thank you.

                    <p> It's only now that I realize why I rely on you for taking pictures, it's 
                        because I didn't have a good camera before, so I always asked you to take 
                        them for me. In addition, you don't often request for me to take pictures 
                        of you. However, now that you have given me a new phone, I'll make up for 
                        the photos so I'll fill up my gallery of your face and I'll never get over 
                        it.
