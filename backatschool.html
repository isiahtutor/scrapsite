                        Although the day may have appeared uneventful on the surface, the 
                        mere fact of being in your company transforms it into something 
                        extraordinary and cherished. Once we had obtain the requirements 
                        you needed from school, we embarked on a delightful escapade to 
                        the arcade, where laughter and amusement filled the air. Engaging 
                        in a myriad of captivating games and challenges, our spirits soared 
                        as we relished every moment of shared joy. These simple yet precious 
                        experiences etched themselves into our memories, turning an otherwise 
                        ordinary day into a treasure trove of delightful memories. And as 
                        we made our way home, the warmth of our connection lingered, 
                        reminding us that even in the simplest of moments, being together 
                        is what makes life special.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Jeepney </h4>

                    <p> If I were going to be honest, I'm not quite sure how to begin this story. 
                        What remains vivid in my memory is how lucky it have been for the both of 
                        us because we both need something from our school. I needed to attend a 
                        meeting with my groupmates for our project and you need to obtain the 
                        requirements you needed from our school. Which is the reason why this 
                        timeline was possible.
                    </p>

                    <p> This picture captures the moment when wer were on our way to school. It 
                        brings back a sense of nostalgia because that's how we used to be. We would 
                        always sit together at the front of the jeepney, and you would often fall 
                        asleep on my shoulder. Hahahaha. I miss that.
                    </p>

                    <!--IMAGE-DESCRIPTION-->
                    
                    <p> It's amusing to think about those days when we used to be so stressed 
                        because every time we went to school, we would always end up arguing 
                        or getting mad at each other without saying a word. It was because you 
                        often took a long time to reach the terminal, and we would end up being 
                        late. However, I didn't realize back then that I should have been more 
                        understanding because you lived in San Roque, which was quite far from 
                        our meeting point. You had to fall in line for a tricycle infront of 
                        McDonald's, then line up at Airport Village, where sometimes there are 
                        no available tricycles, and then another queue for a jeepney after that, 
                        finally the queue for the shuttle. HAHAHAHA. It's quite unveliebale that 
                        you went through that all every single day for 2 straight years, and 
                        I'm actually only realizing it now. I have to say sorry. HAHAHA!
                    </p>

                    <p> At last, we're at the arcade (again) where we really enjoy playing randomg 
                        games. Hahaha. You know what, either it's in our blood to find joy in playing 
                        all sorts of games, or it's just a natural happiness for Gen Z to play, 
                        especially in arcades. Hahaha.

                    <p> Even back then, we really loved playing at arcades, as far as I remember. 
                        We've played before at Timezone in MOA, but I remember we were short on 
                        money. And at the same time, I didn't really feel the joy during those 
                        times because we were still toxic and always arguing about heavy and 
                        random things. Hahaha.

                    <p> I always feel delighted whenever we play at the arcade, even though we 
                        always do the same things over and over again. Hahaha. We always compete 
                        with each other in basketball, even though of course I always beat you. 
                        Hahaha. And we also play car racing or motorcycle racing games. Hays, I 
                        was just thinking what more if I get to be with you again in amusement 
                        parks like Enchanted Kindom or Star City. It would be so much fun, even 
                        if the rides are tiring. Hahaha. I don't know. Maybe I just really miss 
                        you so much.

                    <p> Despite this timeline being relatively not that exciting and light, I 
                        decided to include this story because it holds a special place in my 
                        heart as on eof the most cherished and simplest dates we ever had. The 
                        nostalgic vibe it brings adds to its significance. Although we haven't 
                        publicly acknowledged that we are seeing each other again, we don't 
                        really mind if Melo knows about it, so there's no need to worry. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <p> That's the extent of what happened on this particular day. It was simple 
                        yet remarkable. These are the little things that should never be taken for 
                        granted. So, I am incredibly happy when I'm with you, and I find immense 
                        joy in doing simple things that bring happiness to both of us. I love you.
