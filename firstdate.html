                        On this remarkable day, after enduring the heartache of our break-up, we 
                        found ourselves on our very first date since our hearts mended from the 
                        paint of separation. It was a date that we would always remember, filled 
                        with precious moments and sweet memories. What made it even more 
                        unforgettable was the fact that Mama May had a suspicion that we were 
                        secretly seeing each other again. Little did she know that our love was 
                        slowly reigniting, like flame flickering back to life. Our hearts were 
                        drawn together once more, ready to embark on a new chapter of our love 
                        story.
                    </p>

                    <!--FIRST-HEADER-->
                    <h4> Miniso </h4>

                    <p> This first photo wasn't actually taken at Minisoo, I coulnd't recall the 
                        exact shop it was captured. Hahaha. However, what I do remember is that it 
                        resemble the store where you mentioned those beautiful boxes were being 
                        sold. It was likely the place we initially visited upon entering SM, 
                        before embarking on our grand adventure of exploring the entire mall. 
                        Hahaha. 
                    </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p> If we really try to remember it, in fact, we had quite an eventful time 
                        at SM Sucat with its two large buildings. We ended up getting exhausted 
                        from our constant back-and-forth as we eagerly explored various spots, 
                        shops, and structures we may find along the way. Although the exact 
                        reason for our repeated walk balk kind of eludes my memory, I believe 
                        it was simply because we were trying to find for new destinations we 
                        can visit.
                    </p>

                    <p>As far as I remember, the first place we went to was Minisoo. I don't 
                        recall the exact reason why, but I think you were looking for something 
                        there, it was either a charger or earphones. Furthermore, we wandered 
                        around and we were a bit mischievous going around the place taking 
                        pictures with each other. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="firs-date-first-blockquote">

                        I apologize if there were any pictures that don't follow a sequential
                        order depicting the scenes from this trip. Although this was our first
                        date, my memories of the exact sequence of events are a bit blurry, so 
                        I'm sorry for that.

                    <p> As you can see, we were just wandering around inside Miniso, and I'm 
                        not even sure if we bought what we orignally intended to. HAHAHA. 
                        But I had a great time there. I have many other pictures, but I chose 
                        these because I value the story of our date more than simply 
                        showcasing numerous pictures. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <p> In the other pictures, we were mostly captured laughing and having a 
                        wonderful time. Hahaha. Some of them are a bit chaotic. We got tired 
                        even though we were only at Miniso. However, we were filled with 
                        excitement and energy since it was our first date. We even prayed 
                        that we wouldn't run into anyone we knew cause we were already secretly 
                        dating that time.
                    </p>

                    <!--SECOND-HEADING-->
                    <h4> Nike Store </h4>

                    <p> During this time, we entered the Nike Store to check out various shoes 
                        that were beyond our budget. Hahahaha. However, we had the idea in mind 
                        that checking out shoes may give us motivation for the future we would 
                        be encouraged to work hard for money to enable us to save up and 
                        eventually but the shoes we desired without any hesitation. Besides, 
                        it's rare for me to browse through shoes, even though I didn't find 
                        any thing appealing in the store. Nonetheless, I felt content knowing 
                        that I was able to undulge in that experience once again. Normally, 
                        I only look at shoes when I'm with my dad, and that's when we actually 
                        make a purchase. I don't usually browse shoes alone or during casual 
                        walks since I prefer not to venture out alone. Moreover, considering 
                        we had just come out of a long and strict lockdown, those moments marked 
                        my return to going out to malls again.

                    </div>

                    <p> We were basically just romaing around the store, and you were trying 
                        to capture a good picture of me so I could post something on my socials 
                        while I was trying to look for a good shoes. It's like you were my secret 
                        stalker on the side, because you were letting me browse through the shoes 
                        while taking hidden pictures of me to make it look candid. You're such 
                        a cutie. Hahahaha.
                    </p>

                    <div class="content-img-container-first-date-two"></div>

                    <p> At this time, our activities were fairly limited to look at shoes and 
                        finding to capture a good photo of myself to share on my Instagram. 
                        Honestly, I am genuinely appreciative that you were the one who came 
                        into my life once again, because it was at that moment when I started 
                        frequently posting pictures of me on my Instagram account. Since 
                        previously, I had little to no one taking pictures of me, and when 
                        someone do, the results were often unflattering or some are unattractive. 
                        Hahaha.
                    </p>

                        note: I really apologize for this matter because I couldn't exaclty
                        remember what happened on this store. Although, what I just mostly 
                        remember is that we were just trying to look for a good shoes to 
                        put it on our wishlist.

                    <h4>Dressing Room </h4>

                    <p> I don't quite recall the specific store, but what stand out in my memory 
                        is what we did there. I remember that we were picking out various clothes 
                        to try on. Although I don't have any pictures of the outfits we tried on, 
                        I distinctly remember taht I was the one selecting items for you to try, 
                        and then it wasa your turn to choose items for me after. Hahaha. It must 
                        have been so much fun if we actually had the mean to make purchases at 
                        that time, noh? Unfortunately, we didn't have the funts yet. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <div class="content-img-container-first-date-three"></div>

                    <p>
                        I have vivid memory of the moment when you were trying on clothes, and 
                        as I watched you in each dress, you looked absolutely stunning. I have 
                        to admit, you were so captivating that I couldn't help but feel the urge 
                        to sneak into the dressing rom and give you a kiss, just to intensify 
                        the rush of excitement I felt. Haha! I feel incredibly lucky to have 
                        such a beautiful girlfriend like you. I can't wait for the day when I 
                        can proudly call you my wife. Sending lots of love and kisses, xoxo. 
                    </p>

                    <div class="first-date-container-two">

                        <img src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-dressing-room.jpg" class="dressing-room">
                        <img src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-dressing-room-1.jpg" class="dressing-room">

                    </div>

                    <p> I just really wish that we could do it again in the future, but at that 
                        time, we could actually buy those beautiful clothes we tried on. Because 
                        as far as I remember, every time we went to the malls, we would always 
                        ended up window shopping. We would try on so many clothes, but we never 
                        actually bought them. So many clothes went to waste or ended up in someone 
                        else's hands because we couldn't afford to buy them. Haha!
                    </p>

                    <p> Nonetheless, I'm still really happy whenever we do these kinds of things. 
                        It adds excitement and creates lasting memories in our minds. Besides, 
                        just spending time with you alone already makes me the happiest. It's 
                        truly a bonus that we got to go to the mall and have a little budget 
                        to enjoy ourselves.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Finally The Arcade </h4>

                    <p> First of all, I would like to apologize if this picture may not accurately 
                        depict the specific point in time I'm referring to. I'm not entirely sure 
                        if this was the exact moment, but I chose this photo because it captures 
                        us on the way to which I am not capable of remembering. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <div class="first-date-container-three">

                        <img src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-holding-hands.jpg" class="holding-hands">
                        <img src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-elevator-leni-1.jpg" class="leni">

                    </div>

                    <p> We were really firtatious during that time, haha! It was our first date, 
                        after all. We often stood side by side in the elevator, and if we weren't 
                        holding hands, we were arm in arm or taking pictures together. Since I'm 
                        not sure about the timing of these photos, let's pretend and assume that 
                        this was when we were heading to the arcade so I could at least include 
                        them because we both look cute. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <div class="first-date-container-four">

                        <video src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-arcade-video.MOV" class="arcade-video" controls></video>
                        <video src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-arcade-video-1.MOV" class="arcade-video" controls></video>

                    </div>

                    <p> When we arrived at the arcade, we didn't expect it to be so crowded. 
                        But our favorite game to play was basketball, haha!. I don't know why 
                        you enjoyed playing that shooting game so much, but you looked so 
                        adorable every time you played it with me. Even though it wasn't your 
                        usual sport, you truly enjoyed competing with me and trying to beat 
                        my score.
                    </p>

                    <p> Since there were still many people playing basketball at the arcade 
                        at this time, we decided to play racing games first. Although, it 
                        was a shame that we couldn't race together. We though the two games 
                        were connected and we could play on the same track. We took a while 
                        to choose our cars and tried different maps, only to find out that 
                        we couldn't play it in one game. HAHAHA. It was a dissapointment, 
                        but at least we still had fun.
                    </p>

                    <p> I don't remember all the games we played at this arcade, but we got 
                        tired after spending some time there, so we eventually looked for a 
                        place to eat afterward.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Time For Dinner </h4>

                    <p> Finally, it's time to eat, hahaha! We were exhausted from wandering 
                        around the mall almost the entire day. From what I can remember, we 
                        were unsure where to eat, and we were even calculating if t he food 
                        we were considering was worth the expenses. We initially wanted to 
                        try buying corndogs and milk tea, but our budget couldn't handle it, 
                        so we ended up at the food court.
                    </p>

                        <img src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-dinner-2.jpg" alt="" class="dinner">

                    </div>

                    <p> You know that I love sisig, it's automatic that I would order it, 
                        esecially in unfamiliar caterings. It's just to play safe because 
                        I don't know the taste of their other dishes, so I stick with sisig. 
                        Furthermore, I remember that it's somewhat my fault why you chose 
                        to order that porkchop with gravy. Hahaha! I recall you asking for 
                        my suggestions, and I, being someone who gives suggestions without 
                        actually trying them, recommended it. Hahaha! I'm sorry. It looked 
                        so delicous on the menu, it was also because of its catchy name, 
                        and when you tasted it, it turned out not to be as tasty as it 
                        sounds. Hahaha! Their porkchop was surprisingly tough and chewy. 
                        LOL.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p> So this is what I was talking about earlier. We kept going back and 
                        forth and wndering aroun the mall. I placed it here because I'm not 
                        exactly sure if this was when we were still looking for a place to go, 
                        or if this was already the moment we decided to go straight somewhere 
                        we wanted to visit. Our timeline here is a bit confusing because I'm 
                        not very sure of the exact sequence of events, but I hope you can 
                        still understand. HAHAHA! I love you.

                    </p>

                    <h4> Parking Pictorial </h4>

                    <p> After we finished eating, I felt so full, and we decided to head back 
                        home. We wanted to rest because, of course, we were tired from all the 
                        walking and roaming around the mall. But even so, we still had enough 
                        energy to take pictures in the parking area for fun.
                    </p>

                    <div class="first-date-container-six">

                        <img src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-parking-lot.jpg" alt="" class="parking">
                        <img src="./pics/FIRST-DATE/first-date-parking-lot-1.jpg" alt="" class="parking">

                    </div>

                    <p> This was actually a fantastic photoshoot. The shots you took of me here 
                        are beautiful. That's why the pictures I posted on Instagram turned out 
                        great. I truly appeciate and admire your dedication in capturing such 
                        wonderful moments of me, even though I'm not skilled at taking your 
                        pictures. Hahaha! Sorry. All I wanted to say is thank you for capturing 
                        these amazing pictures of me.
                    </p>

                    <p> Anyways, I couldn't help but laugh at the second picture because there 
                        were so many people passing by and some were even looking at me. As 
                        someone who's a camera shy, I felt a bit embarrassed with all the 
                        attention I had (even though it wasn't as many), especially when there 
                        was a car with a bright light in front of us. I felt shy and at the same 
                        time, I'm not really a good at posing for pictorials. So, my poses 
                        were almost repetitive, and I didn't know what to do next. Although, 
                        luckily I had a skilled photographer, so no matter how awkward my 
                        posing were, the shots still turned out great. Hehe.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="last-block-quote">
                        Although, that was all the summary that happened on our first date, 
                        there is still a story after that. When we were going home.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h4> On The Way Home </h4>

                    <p> I honestly don't have any pictures for this exact moment. However, 
                        as we were heading home, I vividly remember how tired we were on 
                        the jeepney and then moments later, you leaned on my shoulder. I 
                        missed those moments when you used to do that to me before. I always 
                        recall those instances whenever we were going home from school. I 
                        was incredibly happy at that time, even though we weren't officially 
                        together yet. I could truly feel that you were the one I still wanted.
                    </p>

                    <p> I don't have any pictures of us on our way back home from SM Sucat. 
                        But I think it's also an important part of our trip to share. But 
                        before that, I just wanted to mention that one of the reasons this 
                        trip happened was because I had an assignment that required me to 
                        send a letter from the post office of Paranaque to Asia Pacific 
                        College. So, luckily it turned out to be a blessing in disguse, 
                        and our first date pushed through. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <p> Going back, I remember when we were on the tricycle heading to 
                        Betterliving, your mom called you and asked where you were. I don't 
                        remember the exact words you said, but we were both nervous because 
                        you didn't know how to respond. At the same time, Jam was already 
                        looking for you, because you told your mom that you are with here. 
                        Hahaha. At the same time, I was hesitant to admit that I was with 
                        you because we were secretly eeing each other.
                    </p>

                    <p> Anyway, our day ended happily enjoyed every last bit of time 
                        without experiencing any problems. There's always that anxious 
                        feeling during the journey home when it's late then mom calls. 
                        LOL. Luckily, as time went by, we were able to work things out, 
                        and I was welcomed to your family once again.
                    </p>
