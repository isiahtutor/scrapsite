                        The day our eyes met once more, I felt a pump in my chest 
                        that I thought long was gone. In this day, I realized that 
                        my heart had been beating for you all this time, despite the 
                        passing years and the distance between us. I never could have 
                        guessed that it was always you, it was still you, waiting to 
                        be found, waiting to reignite the flame that had never truly died. 
                        This is the story of how we rediscover each other, and how that 
                        chance encounter brought us back to the love we though we had 
                        lost forever.

                    <h4> McDonalds Betterliving Subdivision</h4>
                    <p> We were thrilled about our upcoming outing, and as a result, 
                        we arrived at McDonald's before everyone else. While the others 
                        were still preparing their belongings, we decided to hang out at 
                        McDonald's, which was our designated meeting place.

                    <p>Group Picture of Us (Me, Ysma, Vince)</p>

                    <p> But before anything else, Vince, Ron, and Ysma were already teasing 
                        me about you. Although I sometimes played along, I denied any reamining 
                        feelings for you since I had moved on by that time. However, I cannot 
                        deny that their teasing still bothers me and makes me nervous every 
                        time I think about it because I do not want any complications between 
                        us. I do not want to be trapped to a box about us anymore.

                    <h4> On the way to the summit</h4>

                    <p> This time, we are already heading to the summit. But before that, 
                        it was really awkward between the two of us. We didn't even look at 
                        each other, and we just wanted to enjoy our trip. Furthermore, before 
                        we started climbing to the summit, I remember you puttitng a water bottle 
                        in Michelle's bag which I was holding because I said I would carry it. 
                        Then, I joked and said "Ano ba yan ang bigat!" HAHAHA. I said that to 
                        break the awkwardness between us and to make you feel less embarrassed 
                        because I really didn't want things to be awkward between us. But then, 
                        our friends were like, "Yieee", as if they were teasing us. HAHAHA! Then 
                        we started heading to the mountain. LOL. <br> <br>
                    </p>

                    <img class="img-content-one" src="./pics/HIKING/hiking-otw-summit.jpg" alt="image">

                    <p> As we were on our way to the top, I remembered that I was helping almost 
                        everyone, but when it came to you, I passed you on to someone else. (LOL) 
                        This was not because I didn't want to help you, but because I didn't want 
                        to touch you and make things awkward between us. I also didn't know if you 
                        wanted me to help you or not, so I rejected the idea of assisting you. (HAHAHA)
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        note: I aplogize because I didn't have enough photos to all the happenings during 
                        the trip. I also don't have enough ideas to anyone who still has photos within 
                        this trip. Additionally, I really wanted to keep this as secret as possible 
                        so it will be a great surprise for you. Furthermore, I hope you can still appreciate 
                        and trigger deep memories from this and recall all the joyful moments we 
                        shared on this day.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h4>Finally The Summit</h4>
                    <p> The summit is so admiring. I remember all the things we talked about in our messenger 
                        group chat, particularly about there having a BJ at the top. (AYO?) Chill out because 
                        it means Buko Juice. (LOL) I was actually expecting a flat surface where you could 
                        look down, however it was still quite rocky and uneven. I also remember you sharing 
                        stories about your aunts and her companions getting into arguments because some 
                        were slower than others, but thankfully everyone in our group was understanding 
                        and there were no fights that happened. (HAHAHA).
                    </p>

                    <img class="img-content-two" src="./pics/HIKING/hiking-summit.png">

                    <p>
                        Not much happened between us at the top, but it was a great experience and views 
                        were stunning. I almost forgot Christian was with us on the trip, but he wasn't in
                        the picture because he couldn't handle it. (HAHAHA).
                    </p>

                    <h4> The River </h4>

                    <p> When we were already going down the mountain, I vividly remember how exhausted 
                        we all were. You and Joli were the first ones to arrived the bottom. I really 
                        wanted to assist Michelle and Elmo going down because they were having a hard 
                        time. So, we paused for a bit but when it was time to go down, I couldn't take 
                        my exhaustion any longer. So, I forced myself to push through the head. Kuya 
                        kept saying that we were almost there, but we weren't. (HAHAHA) When I finally 
                        decided to go down alone, I almost got lost. Thankfully, I asked the locals for 
                        directions. I would have been in another village if I hadn't. (LOL)</p>

                    <p> Anyway, after we all arrived the bottom. I remember everyone was already hungry 
                        including me. And as you know, I always try to make jokes to who is ever with me 
                        to treat me something. I was jokingly bothering Joli until unexpectedly Joli treated 
                        my meal at the eatery we went to. I noticed that you were laughing at me, and notice 
                        every move I make. (Hmm.. Crush mo talaga ako eno HAHAHA).
                    </p>

                    <p> After the eatery, you were inviting me to join you and Joli at the other River, 
                        but I declined the offer because I didn't have enough money for fare. Also, I didn't 
                        want to join because if I were to, it is just going to be the three of us. There's 
                        nothing weird about it though, but I am not that fully comfortable having just the 
                        three of us that time. Although, I feel like you really wanted me to come along I 
                        declined the offer. I regretted not joing you guys though. (LOL). I saw the pictures 
                        and it was amazing.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-content-three"></div>

                    <p> I have to admit, you and Joli took so long to arrive at the camp. I was already 
                        very tired, so I decided to take a nap in the Kubo. I didn't know if I was bothered 
                        or just really wanted to see you back. Hays. (I guess I'm really a clown HAHAHA). 
                        Anyways, both of you took so long that when I woke up, both of you still haven't
                        arrived. So, I joined our friends at the river in front of our campsite (becuase
                        they were already swimming before I took a nap) and took a dip and played around
                        with them.
                    </p>

                    <p> After awhile, you guys finally arrived and joined us. We then swam in the deeper part 
                        of the lake. This picture was captured by Ysma, and they teased me that I was assisting 
                        you or helping you on our way back to the Kubo (which is not true, HAHAHA). They said 
                        that it was just the two of us, but you can see in the picture that Joli was also with 
                        us, and by the way, I remember as you can see I was wearing your shades. LOL.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Dinner is Ready </h4>

                    <p> I'm laughing so hard at this moment. HAHAHA. This is when we were eating and they grilled 
                        hotdogs, but some of them were so burned. The boys were passing around the burned hotdogs 
                        and they kept on saying, "Eto pre oh paminta". HAHAHAHA. It's just so funny. (LOL). But 
                        the food were so delicious, although I think it could have been more better if it was 
                        cooked natural meat with salt in it. I believe it's more delicious without having barbecue 
                        sauce in it. (LOL).
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-content-four"></div>

                    <blockquote>
                        I just really wanted to share that moment. Nothing much happened between us though, but 
                        it was a memorable and funny experience.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h4> Campfire </h4>

                    <p> The only thing I remember from this time is that I didn't expect them to make such a strong 
                        fire, HAHAHA. So what happened was I kept changing my spot, and at the same time, I felt 
                        uncomfortable sitting next to you because you were talking to Vince about something I am 
                        not sure of so I kept moving from one place to another. We haven't started drinking hard 
                        yet, so nobody was getting drunk and we were just chilling at the spot. But after a while, 
                        people started leaving because it was getting too hot, HAHAHA. It wasn't that cold at our 
                        campsite in the first place so we weren't really craving that much heat either.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-content-five"></div>

                    <p> After the campfire, I spent some time in Elmo and Michelle's tent with Joli. You know 
                        what we did there, it wasn't that bad though, but I think it's not really appropriate to 
                        talk about that here. HAHAHA. Anyway, I don't have an idea where you went after the campfire, 
                        I think you and the others started setting up for drinking the hard drinks. Minutes later,
                        I finished my business in the tent with Elmo, Michelle, and Joli I left the tent, then Joli 
                        and I joined you guys.
                    </p>

                    <h4> It Got Heated</h4>

                    <p> This is where it all started. You were already getting a bit drunk and you were talking to 
                        Vince about something that I am not sure what it was about. I wasn't really paying attention, 
                        and then I heard about you having issues with our APC friends such as Vega, Zahmer, and the others. 
                        As when I looked at you, you were already starting to cry. I was a bit triggered about what you 
                        said so I spoke for my intention to help you understand what do our APC friends really feel about 
                        you. As I have mentioned, I really wanted to stop having issues between us. So, I started saying. 
                        'Sige, ano ba yung gusto mo malaman? Makikinig ako.' (not the exact words, but something like that). 
                        Anyway, that's when the cold night heated. You didn't want to talk about it because at the same 
                        time you were already drunk. However, our friends kept instigating and saying we should talk 
                        about it to resolve things.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-content-six"></div>

                    <p> Since I saw you crying, I don't know why but I also started crying too. Maybe 
                        because at the same time, even though I was totally moved-on from you. It 
                        bothers me to see that you are crying because of something that has happened 
                        between us from the past. At that moment, I started having thoughts and getting 
                        questions to my head like, I've moved-on, I am already happy, It's been 2 
                        years already, but why does it feel like there's still an issue between us? 
                        Why are you crying? Is it my fault? My emotions were mixed up and I didn't know 
                        the right reaction, so I cried slowly.
                    </p>

                    <p> I went up the stairs to relax a bit and I saw Ysma was still awake. I told 
                        him to come beside my because I needed someone to talk to. I asked him why do 
                        you think it's like that, why is there still and issue even though it's been a 
                        long time? Why were you crying? (again, not the exact sentences I said but at 
                        least what I remembered talking about). After what happened, Jam suddenly said 
                        that you wanted too talk to me. and since I had stopped crying and felt okay 
                        again, I was ready to tallk to you.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Things Got Better </h4>

                    <p> Honestly, I mostly forgot what we talked about up there. What I mostly remember 
                        is that I clarified the issues you were having about what our APC friends think 
                        of you. They weren't really angry with you, nor hate you, it's just that during 
                        that time they were just supporting me as friend because you moved-on to another 
                        guy too quickly. Of course, as every friend would do, they will be mad at someone 
                        who do things bad to you when things like that happen, right? Additionally, 
                        during that time, maybe they were just taking my side, and as you can see right 
                        now, they don't really care about what we do with our lives.
                    </p>

                    <p> Going back to our conversation upstairs, we have talked about a lot of things. 
                        As more time goes by, we were feeling more comfortable with each other. Honestly, 
                        maybe it's a bit of my fault for being kind of annoying and teasing you about 
                        Valorant, because the more I talked to you about it, we're becoming more at 
                        ease and comfortable with each other.

                    </p>

                    <p>I don't know how to put all the things we talked about in detail, but we talked 
                        for a long time in the Kubo until we became okay with each other and resolved 
                        the issues that needed to be resolved. <br> <br>
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-content-seven"></div>

                    <p> After talking for I gues an hour in the Kubo, I went back down to the bottom 
                        to relax. I puffed my Sauna to relax a bit more. Then, I joined Vince and had 
                        a little more to drink while they are talking with each other. That was the time 
                        I was talking about when I couldn't stop laughing at Xtian because he was staring 
                        at a blank space for about 10 minutes saying nothing and suddenly blurted out 
                        that he didn't deserve Tonette. That's when it all started, those days when Xtian 
                        started saying that he thinks he want to break up with his girlfriend Tonette.
                    </p>

                    <p> After everything that happened, we're finally okay and I was able to sleep soundly, 
                        thanks to the alcohol and "Sauna" that I had with me. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Good Morning </h4>

                    <p> In the morning, I woke up feeling great next to Ysmael and Vince, although 
                        I can't remember how I woke up. It was cold since the sun isn't peeking at 
                        the clouds yet, so it was nice to snuggle under the blankets because it was 
                        cold like we were inside an air-conditioned room. However, the two idiots 
                        beside me were already being silly and joking around, even though it was 
                        still early in the morning.
                    </p>

                    <p> Eventually, the weather got warmer and everone started getting up. Before 
                        heading home, we had lunch to finish up the remaining food. Some of us, 
                        including me, also took a dip in the river before leaving.
                    </p>

                    <p> There was nothing much that happened between us, and we didn't really 
                        talk much since I wondered if you still even rememberedd our consversation 
                        from the previous night because you got drunked. So, I just went about 
                        doing what I wanted to do that day.
                    </p>

                    <p> Before going home, I remembered that Elmo's car window was broken and the 
                        plan was for all the girls to ride in Elmo's car. However, Jam and Ron 
                        wanted to ride together, so they ended up riding in Elmo's car instead. 
                        So, both of you and Joli ended up riding in Xtian's car with us.
                    </p>

                    <div class="img-content-eight-container">

                        <img src="./pics/HIKING/hiking-before-otwh.jpg" alt="image-eight" class="otwh">
                        <img src="./pics/HIKING/hiking-car-before-otwh.jpg" alt="image-eight" class="car-otwh">

                    </div>

                    <p> What I remember most before we went home was when you got into the car, 
                        we all thought you would let Joli ride first so you wouldn't have to sit 
                        beside me, but you went ahead and got in first, so we ended up sitting 
                        beside each other. Although, it wasn't really a problem for me, people 
                        were thinking at that time that you had a boyfriend and everything between 
                        us was already resolved last night, so it would be better if we didn't 
                        fool around with each other again.
                    </p>

                    <p> However, both of us were still silly with each other. Although I can't 
                        just blame only you because I at the same time were also trying to joke 
                        around with you. At that time, I didn't really care and I didn't consider 
                        anything. I was just trying to be myself and I only care about my self. 
                        Hahaha. So, we started talking about KDrama that you guys have watched 
                        and I was also borrowing Joli's "Sauna" so all the stories we were talking 
                        about were mixed-up. At some time, we were trying to joke around and being 
                        silly with each other  and I didn't know if that was right or wrong because 
                        we had a heavy past between us and you had a boyfriend that time. So, I 
                        guess we should have focused on trying to be separated even though 
                        everything was already resolved between us. However, maybe it was just 
                        meant to happen. (HAHAHA).
                    </p>

                    <p> As time passed by, everyone got hungry and maybe the people weren't ready 
                        to go home yet because we were still enjoying ourselves at the moment. So, 
                        we all decided to look for a place to eat first, and we endedup stayiing at 
                        Mang Inasal.
                    </p>

                    <p> Honestly, the most memorable thing that only happened to us in the car was 
                        the numerous KDrama suggestions you gave me, which I haven't watched all of 
                        it until now. Hahaha. Then, I wrote them down on my Samsung notes and labled 
                        them as Legendary. Hahaha.
                    </p>

                    <p> After eating, we finally decided to go straight home, so riding after an hour, 
                        we finally arrived in Betterliving and everyone startedd to go home ony by one. 
                        I was already so tired, so I didn't get off at Sinangag Express and got off at 
                        Puregold instead. Hahaha. Although, I remember you were reminding me to watch 
                        all the KDramas you suggested and told me to send both of you and Joli a reaction 
                        after watching. Furthermore, after leaving, everyone went home happily.
                    </p>
