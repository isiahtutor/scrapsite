                    a journey through Isiah and Ishi's relationship, seeing all
                    the special moments they shared. Whether it's a romantic
                    getaway, a special anniversary, or a simple moment of joy,
                    each entry on the timeline will serve as a reminder of the 
                    love and happiness that they shared.
